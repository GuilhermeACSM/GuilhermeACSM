# Hello, I'm Guilherme Augusto <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1570211625/6611/wave-animated.gif?1570211625" width="30"/>

I'm completing my technical course as a **Computer Technician for the Internet** at Senac Santos.
<br>

### 🚀 Technologies I work with:

- **PHP**: I use PHP to build powerful, scalable server-side applications. Whether it's creating custom websites or developing complex web systems, PHP is my go-to language for back-end development.
  
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is the language that brings my web projects to life. I use it to build interactive and engaging user experiences, and I'm comfortable with vanilla JavaScript.
  
- **HTML & CSS**: These are the building blocks of any web project. I use HTML for structuring content and CSS for styling it, ensuring that my websites are responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly.
  
- **MySQL**: I rely on MySQL to manage and query data efficiently. Whether it's building a small-scale application or a larger enterprise solution, I use MySQL to create reliable, fast, and secure databases.

- **Mobile**: I am currently exploring mobile development using React Native. It allows me to build cross-platform apps for both iOS and Android, creating seamless and user-friendly mobile experiences.

- **API Development**: I have learned to develop and integrate APIs using both PHP and React Native. I’m familiar with RESTful services, handling data transfer, and making my applications more dynamic and scalable through API interactions.

### 🌱 Currently learning:

- Improving my skills in **API development** and integration.
- Improving my skills in **MOBILE development** and integration.

### 🔧 My Development Tools:

- **VS Code** for writing clean and efficient code.
- **Git** and **GitHub** for version control and collaboration.

### 💼 Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on, ranging from personal experiments to professional-grade applications:

- [Mosquito Slayer Game](https://github.com/GuilhermeACSM/JogoDoMosquito) – A fun game project where players need to kill a mosquito. Built with JavaScript and HTML.
- [Help-Desk](https://github.com/GuilhermeACSM/HelpDesk) – A web-based help desk application where users can manage support tickets. Built with PHP and MySQL (both PDO and non-PDO versions). I learned a lot about database interaction, security practices, and user authentication while developing this project.
